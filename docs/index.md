**One sentence on impact:** In three days, Group 18 is prototyping cross-cutting interoperability workflows that let partners combine climate, ecological, and social datasets without friction.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
-A call to action for broader community change/standards
- a paper for standards in metadata to future-proof data to ensure future utility. We can't imagine what our data can be useful for in the future. How can we generalize across our disciplines? Maybe special issue Environmental Data Science, ideas by Nov 2025, full article by spring 2026
- an open source tool that translates the academic paper

### Our question(s) üì£
- Can we use AI/LLMs for identifying if datasets are fit for use?
- Can we do a review of the metadata standards that exist for FAIR data principles or siloed projects (coping with FAIR Maricela)
- We have to behave differently before we can even get to FAIR

### Hypotheses / intentions
- usefulness of data goes down and cost goes up
- museum/library/archival perspective on data accessibility over time versus data scientist view on data is "useful/accessible" for 5 years max


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
- in order to operationalize FAIR we have to have community standards that everyone adheres to (DARE?)
- for such a data centric group
- data isn't "useful" broadly to the community
- standardizing the standards
- there's no problem that's not interdisciplinary, it might be better if we have broader community standards

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [The FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
- Dataset portal: [EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway](https://edg.epa.gov/)
- Tool/tech: [Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org/)

### Field notes / visuals
<!-- EDIT: Replace with a real smartphone photo or sketch; keep filename simple. -->

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO)** ‚Äî hourly precipitation and temperature summaries that we will harmonize with partner-held observations.

  ![Pattern revealed during exploration](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/cross-cutting-data-interoperability-harmonization-innovation-summit-2025__18/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot highlighting how CDO variables vary across pilot watersheds.*

- **USGS Water Services API** ‚Äî near real-time streamflow indicators to pair with ecological and community datasets for interoperability testing.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Metadata crosswalks and schema mapping powered by frictionless data packages.
- Automated vocabulary translation notebooks (Python) that align partner terminology.
- Visualization prototypes that compare harmonized and raw feeds for quick QA/QC checks.

### Challenges identified
- Differing temporal resolutions make alignment tricky without resampling guidance.
- Some partner feeds lack machine-readable metadata, requiring manual curation.
- We still need to prioritize which interoperability blockers are most urgent for downstream users.

### Visuals
<!-- EDIT: Swap examples; keep file sizes modest. -->

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing 
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2‚Äì3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage üì£: Why ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Data/Methods ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Next.*

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Harmonized schemas cut manual data-mapping time by **40%** in our pilot workflow.
- Automated vocabulary translation enabled two agencies to align QA/QC flags in a single notebook run.
- Shared data contracts clarified stewardship roles, unlocking commitments to sustain the service beyond the summit.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Finalize documentation for the interoperability playbook and publish version 1.0 to the repo.
- Meet with summit partners to prioritize which additional datasets join the harmonization pipeline.
- Schedule a spring 2025 workshop to onboard new collaborators to the shared workflows.
